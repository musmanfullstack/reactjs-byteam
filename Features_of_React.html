---Features of React
"React offers some outstanding features that make it the most widely adopted library for frontend app development."
---JSX 
"JSX is a JavaScript syntactic extension. It's a term used in React to describe how the user interface should seem. You can write HTML structures in the same file as JavaScript code by utilizing JSX.
const name = 'Simplilearn';
const greet = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
The above code shows how JSX is implemented in React. It is neither a string nor HTML. Instead, it embeds HTML into JavaScript code."
---Virtual Document Object Model (DOM)
"The Virtual DOM is React's lightweight version of the Real DOM. Real DOM manipulation is substantially slower than virtual DOM manipulation. When an object's state changes, Virtual DOM updates only that object in the real DOM rather than all of them.
DOM (Document Object Model) treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure in which each node is an object representing a part of the document."
---Architecture 
"In a Model View Controller(MVC) architecture, React is the 'View' responsible for how the app looks and feels. 
MVC is an architectural pattern that splits the application layer into Model, View, and Controller. The model relates to all data-related logic; the view is used for the UI logic of the application, and the controller is an interface between the Model and View."
---Debugging
"React applications are straightforward and easy to test. Facebook provides a browser extension that simplifies and expedites React debugging. 
This extension, for example, adds a React tab in the developer tools option within the Chrome web browser. The tab makes it easy to inspect React components directly."
