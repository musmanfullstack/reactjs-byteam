---Form
"HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state. 
For example, this form in plain HTML accepts a single name."

---Example
<form>
  <label>
	Name:
	<input type="text" name="name" />
  </label>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
