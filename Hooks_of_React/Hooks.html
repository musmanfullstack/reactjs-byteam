---Hooks
"Hooks are a new addition in React. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class."

---Example
import React, { useState } from 'react';
 
function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
	<div>
  	<p>You clicked {count} times</p>
  	<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
    	Click me
  	</button>
	</div>
  );
}
