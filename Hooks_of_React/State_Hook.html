---State Hook
"This example renders a counter. When you click the button, it increments the value."

---Example
import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
	<div>
  	<p>You clicked {count} times</p>
  	<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
    	Click me
  	</button>
	</div>
  );
}
"useState is a Hook. We call it inside a function component to add some local state to it. 
You can call this function from an event handler or somewhere else. 
It’s similar to this.setState in a class, except it doesn’t merge the old and new state together."
