---Using Props in React
"We follow three steps to implement props in a React application fully. These are,"

1-Define an attribute and its value
2-Pass it to child component or components by using props
3-Render the props data

---Defining Attribute and Data
"We can assign data to React components while calling them in this way.
<Child attr1={value} attr2={value}/>
In our case, we will name the attribute as text and assign the string to it.
<Child text={“I’m the 1st child”} />"

---Passing Data using Props
"Now let's take the "Child 1" string and pass it by using props. Passing props is simple, and we can add props like we pass an argument to a function.
const Child = (props) => {  
return <p>Child 1</p>; 
};"

---Rendering Props Data
"Now we need to render props since we have already passed it to the child component as an argument.
const Child = (props) => {  
  return <p>{props.text}</p>; 
};
class Parent extends Component {  
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>
        the parent component.
        <Child text={"Child 1"} />
        <Child text={"Child 2"} />
        <Child text={"Child 3"} />
      </h1>
    );
  }
}"
