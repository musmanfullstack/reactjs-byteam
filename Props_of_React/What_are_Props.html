---What are Props in ReactJS
"ReactJS being a component-based library, the user interface (UI) is divided into small, reusable pieces.
These components might need to send data to each other in some scenarios, and passing data between the components is done by way of props. 
The term "props" stands for "properties" and is used for passing data from one component to another. 
As opposed to state in React, props are read-only. So, the data coming from a parent component can't be changed by the child component."
