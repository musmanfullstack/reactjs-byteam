    <h1>What is React</h1>
    <p>React is an open source, JavaScript library for developing user interface (UI) in web applications. React is developed and released by Facebook. Facebook is continuously working on the React library and enhancing it by fixing bugs and introducing new features.</p>
    <h1>Why React</h1>
    <p><b>creation of dynamic applications:</b>React makes it easier to create dynamic web applications because it requires less coding and offers more functionality.<br>
        <b>performance:</b>React uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating web applications faster. Virtual DOM compares the componentsâ€™ previous states and updates only the items in the Real DOM that were changed, instead of updating all of the components.<br>
        <b>components:</b>Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components.<br>
        <b>data flow:</b>React follows a unidirectional data flow. This means that when designing a React app, developers often next child components within parent components. Since the data flows in a single direction, it becomes easier to debug errors and know where a problem occurs in an application.<br>
        <b>tools for easy debugging:</b>Facebook has released a Chrome extension that can be used to debug React applications.</p>
