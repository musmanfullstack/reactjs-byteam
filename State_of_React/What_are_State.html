---What Is State
"The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A componentâ€™s state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders. The change in state can happen as a response to user action or system-generated events and these changes determine the behavior of the component and how it will render."

---Example
"class Greetings extends React.Component {
  state = {
    name: "World"
  };
  updateName() {
    this.setState({ name: "Simplilearn" });
  }
  render() {
      return(
          <div>
              {this.state.name}
          </div>
      )
  }
}"
