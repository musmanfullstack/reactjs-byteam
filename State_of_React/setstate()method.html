---The setState() Method

"State can be updated in response to event handlers, server responses, or prop changes. This is done using the setState() method. 
The setState() method enqueues all of the updates made to the component state and instructs React to re-render the component and its children with the updated state.
Always use the setState() method to change the state object, since it will ensure that the component knows itâ€™s been updated and calls the render() method."
 
---Example

"class Bike extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
     this.state = {
      make: "Yamaha",
      model: "R15",
      color: "blue"
    };
  }
  changeBikeColor = () => {
    this.setState({color: "black"});
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>My {this.state.make}</h2>
        <p>
          It is a {this.state.color}
          {this.state.model}.
        </p>
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={this.changeBikeColor}
        >Change color</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}"
